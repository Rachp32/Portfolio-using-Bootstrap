The aim of this re-developed portfolio was to incorporate the recently learnt bootstrap elements into my previous code base // The portfolio should have nav bar header Jumbotron / hero section work / about me / aims - i have used the recently learnt card function within bootstrap footer contact section within Commit incorporation of; images, links and navigation links.

// Along with using bootstrap i should also have a separate css file containing additional styling
